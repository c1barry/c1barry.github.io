## Ongoing Research
# Remote, Smartphone-Based Screening For Mild Cognitive Impairment in Older Adults to Assess Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Risk
This project is a collaboration with the Design Lab and Dr. Eric Granholm at the UCSD Center for Mental Health Technologies. With the help of our collaborators, we are investigating the potential for using smartphones as a cheap, remote method of screening for Mild Cognative Impairment. This work builds upon the findings of Professor Granholm and other researchers that have shown connections between mild cognative impairment and pupillary response. We are
