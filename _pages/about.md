My name is Colin Barry and I am a second year PhD student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at UCSD. After completing by Bachelor's Degree in Bioengineering: Biosystems at UCSD in 2016, I followed my interests in machine learning, human centered design, and mobile health to research in the  [Digital Health (DigiHealth) Lab](https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/udcomplab/). The DigiHealth Lab, headed by [Professor Edward Wang](https://www.ejaywang.com/), focuses on developing computational methods for processing the novel data emerging in the mobile health domain. I am also part of the [UCSD Design Lab](https://designlab.ucsd.edu/), which hosts highly collaborative dedicated to solving major world issues through its diverse and inclusive approach.

Beyond research, I am generally interested in effective learning and teaching. I strive not only to learn from the world class researchers here at UCSD, but also to pass along the knowledge, skills, and excitment to the next generation of researchers. I hope to continue my process of improving as a educator rather than just a researcher by mentoring, teaching positions, and outreach programs.
